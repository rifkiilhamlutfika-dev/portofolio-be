    firstContent: `At SMKN 2 Singosari, I learned a lot, from understanding algorithms to creating applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms. What I found most exciting was web development. I started by building websites using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later, I ventured into PHP, which introduced me to working with databases for the first time.<br /> <br /> During my internship and work experience, I began exploring modern JavaScript technologies like Vue.js, React, and others. That’s when I was first introduced to Vue.js. Over time, I continued to expand my knowledge of both Vue.js and React through personal projects. Additionally, I learned to use Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, which helped me create more efficient and powerful web applications.`,
